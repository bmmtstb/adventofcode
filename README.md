Code for the Advent of Code challenges from https://adventofcode.com .  (AOC)

Every day in the advent, a somewhat computer related riddle is published on AOC, with variable input for every user and a validation and scoring system.
The riddles are getting increasingly more difficult in later days.  

## Explanation
For me the challenges started as programming exercises and a way to get more fluent in python. 
Over the years I became better and faster at understanding what to do and how to do it.

My main goal now is to not use any additional libraries, that was possible every time except once I think.
In the last year I created a few
helper functions to streamline some annoying things, like calculations with tuples. This increases readability and reduces the amount of code I have to write.

My side goals are to create clean (humanly readable) code and check every mayor component using Unittests.
Every function has a docstring, but to the overhead on simple tasks I no longer add docstrings for every variable.
In 2020 I even started using the typing module to increase code readability and my IDE workflow.

## 2019
I stumbled upon the AOC in the late days of advent in 2019, but the intcode computer gave me trouble and I couldn't
finish all of the days on time. But I'm planning to do so someday! Intcode I'm coming to conquer you!

## 2020
This was the first year, I participated live. For the first ~20 days this worked great.
But due to a small sentence in Day 17 that I misread my whole schedule was off for the last days, what a shame.

All in all I think that the puzzles in 2020 were "easier for me" than the intcode computer from 2019.
But still multiple solutions had to have some optimization in them, to run for bigger numbers.
For me it seemed like most of the earlier tasks are simple regex tasks, but I still managed to write Unittests for all of them.

## 2021
Challenge went well so far. Most of the challenges were "pretty easy", but I was getting stuck on multiple of the later ones, because I just diddn't get the right ideas. I hope this gets better in 2022.

## pre 2019
Due to me starting in 2019, all prior challenges were done in my spare time.
